# OpeniBoot-Install-Script
Simply download an Ubuntu 12.04 ISO file from [here](http://releases.ubuntu.com/12.04/). Create a VM in whatever software you prefer and setup Ubuntu. Create a directory called `iOS` and copy the `openiboot_install.sh` script into it. Then just run `sudo bash openiboot_install.sh`.
